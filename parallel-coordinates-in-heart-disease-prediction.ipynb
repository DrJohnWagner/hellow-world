She's a doctor doctor! PhD from Berkeley. MD from Stanford. And a Smith grad to boot. And she likes to break the rules. Sure, she's arrogant and condescending--and has the *worst* bedside manner--but Cristina would never waste her time with `matplotlb` or bar charts. No way! She'd pour a glass of wine, roll up her sleeves, `pip install plotly` and start coding up something a little less conventional: a parallel coordinates plot.\n","\n","Parallel coordinate plots allow us to plot all of our patients and (numerical) columns on one plot. Unlike Cartesian coordinate plots, where coordinate axes are perpendicular to one another, in parallel coordinate plots the coordinate axes are placed in parallel. And datapoints, which would be represented as points in Cartesian coordinates, are represented as polylines in parallel coordinates with vertices on the parallel axes.\n","\n","We begin by examining the numerical columns of our first two patients:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"dbd989ed","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-05T08:43:03.114976Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-05T08:43:03.114371Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-05T08:43:03.131279Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-05T08:43:03.130784Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-05T07:41:09.269628Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.041725,"end_time":"2022-01-05T08:43:03.131424","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-01-05T08:43:03.089699","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Age</th>\n","      <th>RestingBP</th>\n","      <th>Cholesterol</th>\n","      <th>FastingBS</th>\n","      <th>MaxHR</th>\n","      <th>OldPeak</th>\n","      <th>HeartDisease</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>40</td>\n","      <td>140</td>\n","      <td>289</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>172</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>49</td>\n","      <td>160</td>\n","      <td>180</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>156</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   Age  RestingBP  Cholesterol  FastingBS  MaxHR  OldPeak  HeartDisease\n","0   40        140          289          0    172      0.0             0\n","1   49        160          180          0    156      1.0             1"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["display(df.iloc[0:2, :][numerical_columns])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5eb93922","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.02343,"end_time":"2022-01-05T08:43:03.178139","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-01-05T08:43:03.154709","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Note that the first patient does not have heart disease, but the second does, and that while the two share the same fasting blood sugar (`FastingBS`) value, all of their other vitals are different.

The majority of patients with heart disease are between the ages of 50 and 65. This is because heart disease tends to occur and be diagnosed by about age 50 and, unfortunately, often starts leading to death around age of 65. That said, old age does not seem to be as strongly discriminating as younger age.\n","1. The mean OldPeak value for patients with heart disease is probably lower than the mean OldPeak value for patients with no heart disease. I also see something similar for MaxHR.\n","1. About half(?) of patients with heart disease have a fasting blood sugar value of 1, but most patients who do not have heart disease have a fasting blood sugar value of 0.\n","1. I see something that I am very familiar with after many years analysing health data...  \n","My blood pressure is extremely stable. It is almost always 106 mm Hg systolic unless I've been doing something to raise it, like walking or exercising or chasing my cat around the house. But if you look in my health records, you'll conclude that it is very consistently 110 mm Hg. But the proper conclusion is that my doctor is lazy when recording my blood pressure. It's somehow easier to write 110 than 106, I guess,  \n","But then again, 4 mm Hg doesn't make that much of a difference. And my doctor knows that.  \n","In any case, you can easily see from the parallel coordinates plot that blood pressure is often rounded off to the nearest 10 mm Hg. We'll look at this next.\n","\n","Note that plotly plots are interactive, and in the caase of parallel coordinate plots, you can do something really useful from a data exploration standpoint: click on any axis, hold the mouse down while you drag (you'll see a thick pink line appear) and then release. The pink line is a slider. Slide it up and down. See what happens? This constraint (plotly calls them constraints) acts like a filter, or data selector. You can create as many constraints on as many axes as you like, even multiple constraints on a single axis. When you're done with a constraint, just click on it and it will disappear. Go ahead and play with them.\n","\n","Moving on...just as an aside, let's examine that last point
